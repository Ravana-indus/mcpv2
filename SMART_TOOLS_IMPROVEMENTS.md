## Migration Guide

### From Basic to Smart Tools

**Before (Basic Workflow Creation):**
```json
{
  "name": "create_workflow",
  "arguments": {
    "document_type": "Sales Order",
    "workflow_name": "Sales Approval",
    "states": [...],
    "transitions": [...]
  }
}
```

**After (Smart Workflow Creation):**
```json
{
  "name": "create_smart_workflow",
  "arguments": {
    "document_type": "Sales Order",
    "workflow_name": "Sales Approval",
    "states": [...],
    "transitions": [...],
    "send_email_alert": 1,
    "is_active": 1
  }
}
```

### Benefits of Migration
